(1) file index.js. 
This file will be responsible for managing the relationships between entities in our database. 
By creating an index.js file in the models folder, we can define and configure these relationships 
using Sequelizeâ€™s associations. This allows us to efficiently navigate and query the database based 
on these relationships.
